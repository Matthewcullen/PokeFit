CHARMELEON mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.	medium-slow	Flame Pokémon	45
37	vulpix	fire	\N	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/37.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/37.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/37.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/37.png	6	99	grassland	At the time of birth, it has just one tail. The tail splits from its tip as it grows older.	Inside VULPIX’s body burns a flame that never goes out. During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this POKéMON releases flames from its mouth to prevent its body from growing too hot.	medium	Fox Pokémon	190
87	dewgong	water	ice	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/87.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/87.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/87.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/87.png	17	1200	sea	Stores thermal energy in its body. Swims at a steady 8 knots even in intensely cold waters.	DEWGONG loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of this POKéMON sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago.	medium	Sea Lion Pokémon	75
109	koffing	poison	\N	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/109.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/109.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/109.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/109.png	6	10	urban	Because it stores several kinds of toxic gases in its body, it is prone to exploding without warning.	KOFFING embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this POKéMON.	medium	Poison Gas Pokémon	190
4	charmander	fire	\N	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/4.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/4.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/4.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/4.png	6	85	mountain	The fire on the tip of its tail is a measure of its life. If healthy, its tail burns intensely.	The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when CHARMANDER is enjoying itself. If the POKéMON becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.	medium-slow	Lizard Pokémon	45
9	blastoise	water	\N	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/9.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/9.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/9.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/9.png	16	855	waters-edge	A brutal POKéMON with pressurized water jets on its shell. They are used for high speed tackles.	BLASTOISE has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.	medium-slow	Shellfish Pokémon	45

BEEDRILL is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest - this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.	medium	Poison Bee Pokémon	45
18	pidgeot	normal	flying	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/18.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/18.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/18.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/18.png	15	395	forest	When hunting, it skims the surface of water at high speed to pick off unwary prey such as MAGIKARP.	This POKéMON has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many TRAINERS are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose PIDGEOT as their POKéMON.	medium-slow	Bird Pokémon	45
91	cloyster	water	ice	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/91.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/91.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/91.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/91.png	15	1325	sea	When attacked, it launches its horns in quick volleys. Its innards have never been seen.	CLOYSTER is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This POKéMON shoots spikes from its shell using the same system.	slow	Bivalve Pokémon	60

DRATINI continually molts and sloughs off its old skin. It does so because the life energy within its body steadily builds to reach uncontrollable levels.	slow	Dragon Pokémon	45
13	weedle	bug	poison	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/13.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/13.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/shiny/13.png	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/shiny/13.png	3	32	forest	Often found in forests, eating leaves. It has a sharp venomous stinger on its head.	WEEDLE has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).	medium	Hairy Bug Pokémon	255

It apparently slows down if they are cut off.	RATICATE’s sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.	medium	Mouse Pokémon	127

Small and very quick, it is a common sight in many places.	RATTATA is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives - it will make its nest anywhere.	medium	Mouse Pokémon	255

GOLBAT bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark moonless nights, flying around to attack people and POKéMON.	medium	Bat Pokémon	90

The longer a GEODUDE lives, the more its edges are chipped and worn away, making it more rounded in appearance. However, this POKéMON’s heart will remain hard, craggy, and rough always.	medium-slow	Rock Pokémon	255

It rolls over any obstacle without slowing or changing its direction.	Rocks are GRAVELER’s favorite food. This POKéMON will climb a mountain from the base to the summit, crunchingly feasting on rocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back down to the bottom.	medium-slow	Rock Pokémon	120

It has to flap its short wings at high speed to stay airborne.	SPEAROW has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.	medium	Tiny Bird Pokémon	255

It leaves a tingling sensation when it licks enemies.	Whenever LICKITUNG comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick.

SCYTHER is blindingly fast. Its blazing speed enhances the effectiveness of the twin scythes on its forearms. This POKéMON’s scythes are so effective, they can slice through thick logs in one wicked stroke.	medium	Mantis Pokémon	45
